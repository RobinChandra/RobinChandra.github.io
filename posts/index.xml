      <description>This website is created to be used as my autobiography, as a platform to share exciting experiences and also to practice my web developing skill. I came across this idea in June 2020, just as I finished my internship and have a bit of free time.
Whatâ€™s the Plan? Articles on this website will be written in both Indonesian and English, for both my friends in Indonesia and also abroad. The topics I will cover will be diverse, from my experience in IBO, OSN, college, to random things such as tea and other things I did in my free time.</description>
