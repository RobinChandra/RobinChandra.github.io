      <description>This website is created to be used as my autobiography, as a platform to share my experiences and also to practice my web developing skill. I came across this idea in June 2020, just as I finished my internship and have a bit of free time. Therefore, there might still be some bugs here and there. Donâ€™t hesitate to give your feedback, ask questions, or even share your own experience.</description>
