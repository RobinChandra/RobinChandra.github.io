          <h1>Applying for Vitol</h1>
        </div>
  
        <div class="post-content" id="post-content">
          <p>Today, I signed my first employment contract offer. It was quite an emotional moment for me, whose path to get a decent job was rough and full of challenges but more on that in the upcoming post. For now, I will discuss more regarding my job application journey with Vitol.</p>
<h5 id="an-initiative">An Initiative</h5>
<p>I noticed the job opening a few weeks back, around the end of June, and immediately thought that this might be it. A Trading Analyst role at Vitol Asia. A job that is, at least for me, exciting and I am familiar with. I knew Vitol back then when I was an intern at Chevron, sending bill-of-lading documents to various stakeholders, and Vitol was one of them.</p>
<p>I applied right away and took the initiative to search for any HR personnel I can contact and talk to regarding my application. Fortunately, the HR Head is on LinkedIn! and he was using premium which allowed me to send a message to him directly.</p>
<p>The following day he reviewed my application and requested me for a short video interview. I was so happy knowing that all was going well and promising. I submitted the videos and then I never hear back from them for the next 3 weeks.</p>
<p>One morning, July 16th 2021, I took the initiative to ask for a follow-up regarding my application, as three weeks is quite a long waiting time for a short video interview outcome. It turned out that they are not interested to hire foreigners anymore as the current Employment Pass (work visa) requires them to pay a foreigner at such a high minimum salary, at 4,500 SGD/month as mandated by the Singapore government since last year.</p>
<p>At this point, I was a bit disappointed to know the fact that it was not me unsuitable for them but the politico-economic condition which hinders me to get the job. Fortunately, was graduated from a local university and have to fulfill my 3-year bond. As you might have known, NUS is a local university and somehow given more flexibility for EP assessment. And the fact that I need to serve my tuition grant bond also helps.</p>
<p>I was quite upset with it and decided to browse the Ministry of Manpower’s website to find any ways I can be employed without having that absurdly high starting salary. It was at that time that I realized we can actually check our eligibility for any work pass by self-assessment.</p>
<p>I filled my credentials and assumed a slightly lower salary (average fresh graduate salary) at the Ministry of Manpower’s Self Assessment Tool and VOILA!!! It said I am eligible for Employment Pass. I passed on this valuable info the HR guy know about this and he quickly responded to proceed with my application.</p>
<h5 id="interview-interview-and-more-interview">Interview, Interview, and More Interview</h5>
<p>A few days later, the HR guy emailed me for an interview with the manager the following day. I was so happy but at the same time scared. I was not prepared at all and the idea of a technical interview sounds scary as well! Nevertheless, it was something I have to pass. I texted my ex-supervisor at Chevron to ask for some advice and she gladly helped me to point out the key areas I have to emphasize and prepare well. I spent the last remaining hours that day skimming through articles and books to get myself prepared for any technical and logic questions.</p>
<p>Just like a blessing from above, the interviewer was urgently unavailable at the agreed timing and the interview was rescheduled to the next day! That’s it, I thought. That was my last chance to be materially and mentally prepared. One piece of advice from me is that this book: “How to Ace the Brainteaser Interview” by John Kador is a must for everyone preparing for an interview.</p>
<p>Here comes the scary part, the interview. It was 2-hours long. The longest time I have been interviewed in my whole life. However, it turned out to be extremely exciting and educational. The interviewer was extremely open-minded, informational, but also willing to test your resilience under stress.</p>
<p>I was asked the whole package of questions, from self introductory, technical, commercial, and even logical questions. No wonder why it took 2-hours to complete. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the whole experience and I honestly got more relaxed towards the end of the interview as our conversation developed into some sort of casual talk.</p>
<p>One week after the first interview, I was informed that the manager (also my interviewer) was keen to move forward with my second application (as a Commercial Research Analyst) but wanted me to be interviewed again by his team members before making his decision. The next few days I saw myself being interviewed again by another 2 colleagues of his.</p>
<p>Overall I was interviewed for three rounds (or four if the first video interview is also counted). I don’t think it is bad or good, but I think it is really helpful for me to know more about the company culture, the job itself, and also the people by having multiple chances to converse with them.</p>
<h5 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h5>
<p>The next morning, I was informed that I have the green light. I was verbally offered the position and earlier today, the written offer was sent to me. I was and am really happy and relieved as my hard work for the past nine months of job hunting finally paid off and come to a close.</p>
<p>Now, I’m looking forward to completing all the necessary documents for the EP application, and hopefully, I will start working by mid-September.</p>
<p>A few things to learn from this experience are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To always take the initiative to talk/chat with the HR personnel for follow-ups.</li>
<li>Be open-minded and willing to learn when being interviewed,</li>
<li>Stay calm under pressure and explicitly show how you process the information given to you whenever you are asked any question during an interview.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you to all my friends and family who have supported and guided me throughout the process. And for everyone else, I hope you can learn something from this experience and I wish you success in your interview!</p>
