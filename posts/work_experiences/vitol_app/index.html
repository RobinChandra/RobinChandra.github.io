          <h1>First Job: Vitol</h1>
        </div>
  
        <div class="post-content" id="post-content">
          <p>Today, I signed my first full-time employment contract offer. It was quite an emotional moment for me, whose path to get a decent job was rough and full of challenges but more on that in the upcoming post. For now, I will discuss more regarding my job application journey with Vitol. <a href="https://www.vitol.com/"><u><b>Vitol</b></u></a>, a Dutch energy and commodity trading company is the largest independent energy trader in the world.</p>
<h5 id="an-initiative">An Initiative</h5>
<p>I noticed the job opening a few weeks back, around the end of June, and immediately thought that this might be it. A Trading Analyst role at Vitol Asia. A job that is, at least for me, exciting and I am familiar with. I knew Vitol back then when I was an intern at Chevron, sending bill-of-lading documents to various stakeholders, and Vitol was one of them.</p>
<p>I applied right away and took the initiative to search for any HR personnel I can contact and talk to regarding my application. Fortunately, the HR Head is on LinkedIn! and he was using premium which allowed me to send a message to him directly through InMail. I basically texted him an excerpt of my cover letter and attached my CV too hoping that he read it and notice my application.</p>
<p>And it works! The following day he reviewed my application and requested me for a short recorded video interview. I was so happy knowing that all was going well and promising. I submitted the videos and then I never hear back from him for the next 3 weeks.</p>
<p>One morning, July 16th 2021, I took another initiative to ask for a follow-up regarding my application, as three weeks is quite a long waiting time for a short video interview outcome. It turned out that they are not interested to hire foreigners anymore as the current Employment Pass (work visa) requires them to pay a foreigner at such a high minimum salary, at 4,500 SGD/month as mandated by the Singapore government since last year.</p>
<p>At this point, I was a bit disappointed to know the fact that it was not because I&rsquo;m unsuitable for position but the its the politico-economic condition which hinders me to get the job. Fortunately, I graduated from a local university and have to fulfill my 3-year bond. As you might have known, NUS is a local university and somehow given more flexibility for EP assessment. And the fact that I need to serve my tuition grant bond also helps.</p>
<p>I was quite upset with how things were turning out and decided to browse the Ministry of Manpower’s website to find any ways to a allow be to be employed without having that absurdly high starting salary (even as far as considering working under S Pass). It was at that time that I realized that we can actually check our eligibility for any work pass by self-assessment from MoM&rsquo;s website. (Click this <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/employment-s-pass-self-assessment-tool"><b><u>link</u></b></a> to open MoM&rsquo;s Self Assessment Tool in case you need it too)</p>
<p>I filled my credentials and assumed a slightly lower salary (average fresh graduate salary in 2020) at the Ministry of Manpower’s Self Assessment Tool and VOILA!!! The result came out, stating that I am eligible for Employment Pass. I again took the initiative to pass on this valuable info the HR guy and he quickly responded to proceed with my application.</p>
<h5 id="interview-interview-and-more-interview">Interview, Interview, and More Interview</h5>
<p>A few days later, the HR guy emailed me for an interview with the manager. The thing is, it was scheduled for the following day. I was so happy but at the same time dreaded. I was not prepared at all for the sudden interview and the idea of a technical interview sounds scary as well! Nevertheless, I knew it was something I have to pass. I knew if I can capitalize on it, it can be a show of force of being able to handle pressure well. I texted my ex-colleagues from previous internships to ask for some advice and they gladly helped me to point out the key areas I have to emphasize and prepare well. I spent the last remaining hours that day skimming through articles and books to get myself prepared for any technical and logical questions.</p>
<p>Just like a blessing from above, on the day of the scheduled interview, the interviewer was urgently unavailable at the agreed timing and the interview was rescheduled to the next day! That’s it, I thought. That was my last chance to be materially and mentally prepared. One piece of advice from me is that this book: <i>“How to Ace the Brainteaser Interview”</i> by John Kador is a must for everyone preparing for an interview. With lots of sample questions and how to solve it, it prepare your mind to have the desired &ldquo;train of thoughts&rdquo; on how to solve brainteaser questions that are frequently asked these days.</p>
<p>Here comes the scary part, the mighty interview. It was scheduled for about half to an hour long but ended up a freakin 2-hours long. The longest time I have been interviewed so far. However, it turned out to be extremely exciting and educational. The interviewer was extremely open-minded, informational, but also willing to test your resilience under stress.</p>
<p>I was asked the whole package of questions, from the typical self introductory questions, technical, commercial, and even logical questions. No wonder why it took 2-hours to complete. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the whole experience and I honestly got more relaxed towards the end of the interview as our conversation developed into some sort of casual talk. To be honest I learned more from the interview rather than just answering questions. The interviewer shared a lot with me, not just about the job, but the basic concepts behind it, his experience and much more.</p>
<p>One week after the first interview, I was informed that the manager (also my interviewer) was keen to move forward with my second application (as a Commercial Research Analyst) but wanted me to be interviewed again by his team members before making his decission ecision. The next few days I saw myself being interviewed again, twice, by another 2 colleagues of his.</p>
<p>Overall, I was interviewed for three rounds (or four if the first video interview is also counted). I don’t think it is bad or good, but I think it is really helpful for me to know more about the company culture, the job itself, and also the people by having multiple chances to converse with them.</p>
<h5 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h5>
<p>The next morning (last Saturday), I received an SMS from the HR guy, informing me that I have the green light. I was verbally offered the position and earlier today, the written offer was sent to me. I was and still am really happy and relieved as my hard work for the past nine months of job hunting finally paid off and come to a close. Later today, I had a brief call with the head of HR discussing about carrer progression, benefits, bonuses, and stuffs. One thing I immediately noticed is that Vitol&rsquo;s philosophy is generally in line with mine in which they really reward all employees generously (or should I say extremely generous) through bonuses rather than high base salary. Which in my opinion really makes sense to encourage loyalty and dedication.</p>
<p>On career progression, Vitol&rsquo;s small team will ensure me being exposed to various functions in the organization. This is, actually one of the main reasons why I decided to choose Vitol. As I know I will be able to learn a lot from the opportunity and who knows if some time in the future Vitol expands it&rsquo;s business to Indonesia, I can be the one experienced enough and with the right background to help them there. In short, the opportunities that Vitol presented to me from this entry position are huge and promising.</p>
<p>As for now, I’m looking forward to completing all the necessary documents for the EP application, and hopefully, I will start working by mid-September. I will share more about my experience working with Vitol later in the future.</p>
<p>A few things to learn from this experience are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To always take the initiative to talk/chat with the HR personnel for follow-ups.</li>
<li>Be open-minded and willing to learn when being interviewed.</li>
<li>Stay calm under pressure and explicitly show how you process the information given to you whenever you are asked any question during an interview.</li>
<li>Maintain good connection with colleagues, friends, ex-boss, and basically anyone. You never know when your path will cross with them again!</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you to all my friends and family who have supported and guided me throughout the process. And for everyone else, I hope you can learn something from this experience and I wish you success in your interview!</p>
