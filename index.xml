      <description>Molecular Biology - Isoelectric Point of Proteins  Q1 The following sequence of template DNA encodes a protein called Pz.Kpfw.VI: 3’-GGTGTCTACATACCACATGGTAGTCTTGGTGCCCCATGCGTCAGAGTGAATCGCCCGTAAATATTTGGTGTGTACCAGCTAACAACTGTACAGGTGT-5’
Q1.A Using the table in Appendix A, identify the polypeptide sequence synthesized! Write your answer from N- to -C and use 3 letters notation (e.g N– GLY ALA VAL –C)
Q1.B Determine the point of isoelectric of Pz.Kpfw.VI! Use Appendix B.
Q1.C Trypsin (N-Lys/Arg-C*) is added to the solution containing Pz.</description>

      <description>This is an account of my internship with Chevron. It was part of my course requirement. At first, I saw the opening on NUS Talent Connect, which is an online job listing platform aimed to help NUS students and alumni alike to find jobs, internships, etc. The application process is typical, but there is an interesting story to share during the interview.
Hot and Humid On the day of the interview, I was not prepared for the hot and humid weather of Singapore.</description>

      <description>This website is created to be used as my autobiography, as a platform to share my experiences and also to practice my web developing skill. I came across this idea in June 2020, just as I finished my internship and have a bit of free time. Therefore, there might still be some bugs here and there. Don’t hesitate to give your feedback, ask questions, or even share your own experience.</description>
