      <description>This website is created to be used as my autobiography, as a platform to share my experiences and also to practice my web developing skill. I came across this idea in June 2020, just as I finished my internship and have a bit of free time. Therefore, there might still be some bugs here and there.
Whatâ€™s the Plan? Articles on this website will be written in Indonesian and English whenever possible, for both my friends in Indonesia and also abroad.</description>
